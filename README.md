## Trivia Game App

A really simple trivia game app made to help a student with his project.

Runs on Rails 5.0.1 with PostgreSQL 9.5.3 (in case you cared).

Click here to see it on Heroku.

Or follow these steps to run it on `localhost`:

1. `git clone` via your preferred method, into your preferred directory
2. `rails db:create`
3. `rails db:migrate`
4. `rails db:seed`
5. `rails s` (short for `rails server`)
6. Go to `localhost` root. (for ex. `localhost:3000`)
7. Play to your heart's content.
